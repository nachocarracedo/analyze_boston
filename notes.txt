In 2017, BERDO requires the following portfolios to report their annual energy and water usage for January 1, 2016 - December 31, 2016:

* Nonresidential buildings that are 35,000 square feet or larger.
* Residential buildings that are 35,000 square feet or larger, or have 35 or more units.
* Any parcel with multiple buildings that sum to 100,000 square feet or 100 units.

The Ordinance also requires these buildings to complete an energy assessment or an energy action every five years

Owners of multiple buildings can compare energy efficiency across their portfolio, and identify the buildings that are most in need of energy improvements. 
It also provides tenants with better information on energy efficiency when making decisions about renting or leasing space.

By providing better information on building energy use, reporting and disclosure is enabling owners and tenants to become more aware of (and oportunities to reduce):

* energy use
* energy costs
* greenhouse gas emissions
