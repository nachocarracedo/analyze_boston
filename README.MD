## Analyze Boston - Track 1: Reducing Boston’s Carbon Footprint

In order to achieve a carbon neutral Boston by 2050 the city needs a good tracking system to explore the BERDO data. Tracking how buildings are doing through the years can yield valuable information. This information can then be used to focus on certain buildings. The information can also be used to understand what factors affect greenhouse gas emissions.

This notebook (berdo_tracker_prototype_Ignacio_Carracedo.ipynb)is a prototype that explores metrics to track. The information on this notebook can them be used to create a tracking app/dashboard.

The first step is to cleaning the data and then, to provide some visualization examples that show the change from 2014 to 2015. I focus on tracking how greenhouse emissions changed from 2014 to 2015, comparing these results with the energy consumption, water used, and the share of each energy source (electricity, gas, steam).

Enjoy!
